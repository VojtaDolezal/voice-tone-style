### Voice-Tone-Style
# Voice
Respectful and Kind – When I communicate with anybody including my friends, clients, parents or elders. I always tend to be respectful and kind. The way your voice sounds, influences the attitude that you are gonna get from the other person as well.

Calm – The same it goes with keeping my voice calm and steady, I would not want anybody to feel incomfortable in any way, during the conversation. From my perspective, sometimes people, who talk too fast and produce an overload of information in a matter of seconds, tend make me feel overwhelmed.

Candid – I always try to be open-minded in every aspect of others opinions and I will also say my opinion whether it is negative or positive, I am not judgemental, but I am honest. Only god can judge.

Original – I like to develop interesting deep talk type of conversations, because who likes small talks nowadays. Every time someone starts the conversation with "Hi. How are you?" it makes me feel a little awkward unless it is my mom or dad, in their case I am kind of used to it.

# Tone 
Slang use and informal – I think majority of people at my age would agree, that keeping a conversation informal is somehow our comfort zone and every time we try to speak formal (for example when it comes to clients), it gets a little intense. I like to speak the same way I speak 95% of my time, helps me to avoid any kind of conversational failures.

Enthusiastic and emotional – My tone usually tends applies to the mood I am currently in, that means everybody recognises how I feel every time I open my mouth, which is sometimes positive and sometimes negative. I tend to be very enthusiastic when explaining something I am passionate about or something that amazes me.

Sharing – My more of a negative trait is that I over-share everything that is happening in my life, some things are just good to keep only to yourself so other people don't use it against you. But the main reason I over-share is that I am extroverted person and I just like the conversation flowing, I do not like the weird silence.

Assertive - I usually am the one who listens to what the other have to say and eventually I will tell if I feel different about the topic.

# Style 

Modest – I do not like to brag or judge myself, my behaviour, or my results when it comes to anything I tried to do as best as I can. I usually say "Yea my performance or creation was okay, but I could have done this and this better."
